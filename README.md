What these visuals represent

      * Plastic waste floating and drifting in oceans

      * Effect of ocean currents on waste movement

      * High-risk waste accumulation zones (hotspots)

      * Planning and prioritization of cleanup areas

🔍 How It Works

    1. Data Collection
    The system uses historical and simulated ocean environmental data such as ocean currents, wind patterns, and waste concentration levels for different ocean regions.

    2. Data Preprocessing
    Raw data is cleaned and structured using basic data processing techniques to ensure consistency and usability for analysis.

    3. Machine Learning Analysis
    A machine learning model analyzes environmental patterns to estimate the risk level of waste accumulation in different ocean zones.

    4. AI-Based Decision Logic
    Rule-based AI logic evaluates ML predictions along with contextual factors (such as proximity to coastlines or sensitive marine zones) to prioritize regions.

    5. Visualization & Output
    High-risk zones are highlighted using visual representations to support cleanup planning and decision-making.
